Flow.py contains Flow class which connects various other classes and maintains the work flow.

<h3>Flow.py</h3>
It contains the following methods to connect various dots<br>
<ol>
    <li>applyFilters. <br> It takes a list of filters and applies all of them and stores inside the data directory.</li>
    <li>applyAugmentation. <br> It takes a dictionary of augmentation operations and applies all of them and stores inside the data directory.</li>
    <li>getDataset. <br> It moves all the processed images into a new folder located in the root folder and creates training and validating numpy datasets.</li>
    <li>deployTensorflowModels. <br> It takes tensorflow model as input and converts into tensorflowjs or tensorflowlite model depending upon the user input.</li>
    <li>detectBlurred. <br> It calculates the focus measure of all images provided by user to detect bluriness under a certain threshold.</li>
    <li>categoriesCountPlot. <br> It creates a document visualising the countplot of different categories in the dataset provided by the user.</li>
</ol>
<br><hr><br>

<h3>Auto_Results.py</h3>
It contains the following methods to get an automated analysis of a trained model<br>
<ol>
    <li>__init__ <br> It takes a trained model, test_x (test data) and test_y (test data labels) and creates a Results directory.</li>
    <li>roc_curve <br> It takes a filename and stores the roc curve plot inside the Results directory.</li>
    <li>confusion_matrix <br> Plots and saves the confusion matrix figure in the Results directory</li>
    <li>precision_recall_curve <br> It takes a filename and stores the precision recall curve plot inside the Results directory.</li>
    <li>get_results_docx <br> It calls all of the above functions with their deafult filenames and stores the figures along with a results.docx inside the Results directory.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tf_Results.py</h3>
It contains the following methods to get an automated analysis of a trained model<br>
<ol>
    <li>__init__ <br> It takes a trained model, validation generator and creates a Results directory.</li>
    <li>roc_curve <br> It takes a filename and stores the roc curve plot inside the Results directory.</li>
    <li>confusion_matrix <br> Plots and saves the confusion matrix figure in the Results directory</li>
    <li>precision_recall_curve <br> It takes a filename and stores the precision recall curve plot inside the Results directory.</li>
    <li>get_results_docx <br> It calls all of the above functions with their deafult filenames and stores the figures along with a results.docx inside the Results directory.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Tf_Results_without_generator.py</h3>
It contains the following methods to get an automated analysis of a trained model<br>
<ol>
    <li>__init__ <br> It takes a trained model, X_test and Y_test( where X_test and Y_test are numpy arrays and shape of Y_test is same as that of the return value of model.predict()) and creates a Results directory.</li>
    <li>roc_curve <br> It takes a filename and stores the roc curve plot inside the Results directory.</li>
    <li>confusion_matrix <br> Plots and saves the confusion matrix figure in the Results directory</li>
    <li>precision_recall_curve <br> It takes a filename and stores the precision recall curve plot inside the Results directory.</li>
